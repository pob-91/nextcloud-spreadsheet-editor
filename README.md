An integration for editing spreadsheets via tools like WhatsApp


### TODO

- Make READ command for category and row number (check there is a category before doing) - can be similar to update but don't look for a number
- Make COMMAND that lists all available commmands, also HELP.
- Make DETAILS command for the formula of a cell
- Make REMOVE command to remove the last thing added to a cell

- Dockerfile
- Upload docker image to docker hub
- Compose stack
- Docs and env vars detailed & steps to get telegram working


### Future

- Add voice integration using whisper or something
- Add in currency converson using symbols or codes e.g. USD, GBP, JPY
- Add in a NEW MONTH command that creates a new month's tab and optionally reads some defaults.
